                    <p>The city’s olive-green canals and handsome gabled mansions are indeed beautiful, but perhaps above all, it’s the flavour of the city that appeals – its inhabitants a creative and imaginative bunch who quite simply bring the place alight.</p>

                    <p>Metro Manila is the country’s economic, political and cultural capital. And it’s chaotic in the best way possible. From the colourful, roaring jeepneys to the dancing traffic enforcers, to the karaoke machines blasting 80s ballads in the streets, everywhere you go is teeming with life. 
                        Metro Manila is one of Asia’s premier regions. From bamboo-bike tours to artisan shopping, and from contemporary art venues to casinos, the Philippine capital is a world in itself, with something to appeal to all ages and tastes when it comes to things to see and do.

                    <p>Porto’s charms are as subtle as the nuances of an aged tawny port, best savoured slowly on a romp through the hilly backstreets of Miragaia, Ribeira and Massarelos. It’s the quiet moments of reflection and the snapshots of daily life that you’ll remember most: the slosh of the Douro against the docks; the snap of laundry drying in river winds; the sound of port glasses clinking; the sight of young lovers discreetly tangled under a landmark bridge, on the rim of a park fountain, in the crumbling notch of a graffiti-blasted wall…</p>
